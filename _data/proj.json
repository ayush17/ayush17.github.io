    "description": "The Dialect Recognition project focuses on building and training a machine learning model to classify regional dialects from audio files using Wav2Vec2, a state-of-the-art pre-trained model for speech processing. The model is trained on labeled audio data and evaluated for its accuracy in classifying dialects. This project aims to contribute to digital forensics and language recognition tasks by enabling automatic dialect classification for better insights and forensic evidence collection, achieving 86\\% accuracy.",

    "description": "I have built a Netflix clone. This React project is currently undergoing development and will contain multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), Sign In, and Sign Up. The Sign In connects to Firebase for user authentication, and the Sign Up uses Firebase Auth to store users in the Firebase database. The app is built with React and uses Styled Components for styling. React Hooks like useEffect, useState, and useContext are used extensively. Fuse.js powers live search, and all components are tested using React Testing Library. React Router is implemented for smooth navigation.",
